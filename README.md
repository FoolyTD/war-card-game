# WAR Card Game Instructions
WAR is a two-player, turn-based card game that uses a standard 52-card deck. We shuffle the cards and then split the deck in two (26 cards per player).
Then, both players flip the top card in their deck. Suit does not matter in this card game, only the value on the card.

In our version of WAR, Ace is the lowest value and King is the highest value. The player with the highest card wins the round and takes both cards that were played.

It gets interesting when BOTH player play a card with the SAME VALUE. Then, WAR is activated and each player plays 4 cards (3 face down and 1 face up).
The player whose face up card has the higher value takes all the cards played! 

The WIN CONDITION is clear: First player to get more than half the deck (27+ cards) wins the game!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
